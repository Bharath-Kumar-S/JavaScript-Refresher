Analyzing Complexity of Binary Search
Binary Search reduces the input size by half on every step, hence it takes log(n) steps to find a target in an array of size n. Thus, the time complexity of Binary Search is O(log n).

Both recursive and iterative approaches share the same time complexity â€” O(log n). Their choice usually comes down to specific problems, constraints, and personal preferences.
